# UniBO-DIT Masters thesis Latex template

A minimalistic template to write a beautiful masters dissertation for UniBO-DIT. 
It contains just the basic files to start writing a disertation: the main latex
file, a tiny bib file, and and a nice bst file.

## Description

Take this project as the starting point for your dissertation writting. All you 
have to do is forking the project and starting to write down.  

## Getting Started

### Setup
You can use a number of text editors/platforms to write your dissertation. I suggest...
* [Kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/). Nice interface, responsive. Type on your left, see the result on your right. It works in Linux ans should work in Windows (I have not managed to make the last version work in OsX). 
* [Atom](https://atom.io/). Nice interface, has to be set up for Latex. No embedded pdf display, but can be combined with [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/). 
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Ideal browser alternative if you prefer simplicity. Type on your left, see the result on your right. It works online. I have no complains using it with Firefox. Cons: you need to be online, not so straighforward version controlling. 

### Compiling

It depends on your platform. It could get launched by just saving the file or you might have to type a command. Get in touch with me once you have decided your setup. 

## Help

If you are a bit lost with Latex, have a look at [Overleaf's documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) or just use your favorite search engine on the fly.
